# JAM Stack Project

Using React, FaunaDB, GraphQL, and Netlify Functions

## Working with Netlify Functions

`netlify dev` to start local server
the server will start in http://localhost:8888

/.netlify/functions/getLinks or /api/getLinks

## Current Problem âš 

### Too tired to finish the add link

Finish the LinkForm component to enable adding links through POST request to /api/createLink

### Postman Agent (25/09/2020)

Postman Agent can't start in my Windows 10 machine. Tomorrow I will restart the PC and then try to start Postman Agent again.

Update (26/09/2020) I can send post request to localhost using Insomnia.REST. Thanks to @azzamsa from the Coding discord server.
